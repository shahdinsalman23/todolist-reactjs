# ToDo List App

A simple, responsive ToDo List app built with React and Tailwind CSS. Users can add tasks with a title and description, view the list of tasks, and delete tasks as needed.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Input title and description to create a new task.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list with a single click.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts to different screen sizes (100% width for smaller screens and 50% for larger screens).
- **Custom Styling**: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern and clean look.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
